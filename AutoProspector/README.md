## Overview

AutoProspector is a groundbreaking tool that leverages the latest advancements in AI, specifically GPT-4 Vision, to detect and localize gold within images. Developed to serve both amateur prospectors and professional mining operations, AutoProspector combines the power of AI with precision image processing to make gold detection faster, more accurate, and more accessible than ever before.

## Motivation

The inspiration behind AutoProspector stems from the recent strides in AI, particularly in the domain of computer vision. GPT-4 Vision has demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in recognizing and interpreting visual data, and we saw an opportunity to apply these advancements to a field traditionally dominated by manual labor and expert knowledge: gold prospecting.

With the costs of API usage for models like GPT-4 Vision becoming more affordable, it has become feasible to integrate AI into practical applications such as mineral detection. AutoProspector was created to explore this potential, offering a tool that not only identifies gold in various geological media but does so with a high degree of precision and reliability.

## Features

### Advanced Image Processing
AutoProspector employs advanced image processing techniques, breaking down images into smaller sections to ensure thorough analysis. This allows for the detection of even the smallest gold flakes, which might otherwise be overlooked.

### Real-Time Analysis
With AutoProspector, users receive real-time feedback on the presence of gold within their images. The tool is designed to differentiate genuine gold from similar-looking substances, providing accurate results that can be acted upon immediately.

### Flexible Processing Modes
AutoProspector offers two distinct processing modes:
- **Batch Processing**: Analyzes multiple sections of the image in parallel, speeding up the detection process.
- **Serial Processing**: Processes each section sequentially, providing a more controlled analysis.

### Customizable Settings
Users can fine-tune the performance of AutoProspector to suit their specific needs. Options include adjusting the subdivision size, enabling or disabling deep scans, and setting the consensus level for detection accuracy.

### Intelligent Bounding Logic
AutoProspector includes complex bounding logic that ensures only relevant regions are highlighted. This reduces unnecessary clutter and helps focus on areas where gold is most likely to be found.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenAI API key for GPT-4 Vision

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoProspector.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AutoProspector
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the AutoProspector script:
   ```bash
   python AutoProspector.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter your OpenAI API key.
3. Select the image you want to analyze.
4. Configure the settings according to your needs (e.g., processing mode, deep scan).
5. Start the analysis and view the results directly within the tool.

## Example Use Cases

### Amateur Prospecting
AutoProspector is ideal for amateur prospectors who want to enhance their gold detection capabilities. By automating the detection process, it allows users to quickly and accurately identify potential gold deposits in their findings.

### Professional Mining
For large-scale operations, AutoProspector can be integrated into mining workflows to assist in the rapid identification of gold and other valuable minerals. This can lead to more efficient mining operations and higher yields.

## Future Directions

The current iteration of AutoProspector focuses on gold detection, but the underlying technology has the potential to be expanded to other precious metals and minerals. Future updates may also include enhanced real-time data integration and more sophisticated image processing algorithms.
