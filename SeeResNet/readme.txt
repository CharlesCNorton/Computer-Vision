# SeeResNet: Real-Time Vision with TensorFlow

Welcome to SeeResNet, where the simplicity of real-time object detection meets the power of TensorFlow. This application combines the robustness of ResNet models with the convenience of a webcam to observe and analyze the world around you, as it happens.

## Overview

SeeResNet is crafted to detect objects in the live stream of your webcam. Whether you're an educator, a developer, or just an AI enthusiast, this tool is tailored for easy integration into your projects, with custom settings to suit your needs. 

## Getting Started

Ready to see what's in view? Start by installing the dependencies and by setting the `MODEL_PATH` to your TensorFlow ResNet model in the script itself, and launch the application. 

## Features

Here's what SeeResNet brings to your screen:
- Leverage a TensorFlow ResNet model for object detection directly from your webcam.
- Fine-tune the resolution of your webcam feed for a balance between clarity and performance.
- Easily navigate through an interactive menu to customize your detection preferences.
- Decide in real-time which objects you'd like to include or exclude from the detection.
- Capture screenshots automatically when a specified class makes an appearance.
- Toggle TensorFlow's verbose logging to dive deep into the workings or keep it simple.

## Moving Forward

Modify the detection settings from the menu to best fit your scene. Want more control over what's being detected or need to capture that perfect shot? SeeResNet is designed to adapt to your vision.

## Known Constraints & Future Developments

We're on a journey to make SeeResNet even better, and for that, we acknowledge the current scope for enhancements:
- Expanding GPU support for speedier detections.
- Developing a GUI for more intuitive interaction.
- Implementing state persistence to remember your settings every time you start SeeResNet.
- Enhancing the logging and analytics for a comprehensive understanding of the detection process.

## Join the Vision

Your insights and code can help shape the future of SeeResNet. We are open to contributions that improve functionality and usability. Let's build an even more versatile detection tool together.
