# BugEye README

## Overview
BugEye is a Python-based tool tailored to investigate the applicability of hexagonal grid overlays in AI-assisted visual inspection tasks. It interfaces with a webcam to superimpose a dynamic hexagonal grid onto the live video feed, providing a numerical reference system for intricate visual analysis. This script constitutes an initial stride towards amalgamating advanced AI analysis tools with visual data segmented by a hexagonal grid pattern.

## Features
- **Dynamic Hexagonal Grid Overlay**: Generates a hexagonal grid over a live webcam feed with customizable hexagon sizes.
- **Numbered Hexagons**: Each hexagon bears a unique identifier, facilitating effortless reference and localization within the grid.
- **Resolution Toggling**: Users possess the capability to dynamically adjust the "resolution" of the grid, i.e., the size of the hexagons, using keyboard inputs.
- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Processes the live video feed in real-time with minimal latency, ensuring a fluid user experience.

## Prerequisites
Before executing BugEye, ensure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:
- Python version 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV-Python
- NumPy

While the program is operational, you can employ the following controls:
- **l**: Set the grid resolution to low (resulting in larger hexagons).
- **m**: Set the grid resolution to medium (default hexagon size).
- **h**: Set the grid resolution to high (resulting in smaller hexagons).
- **q**: Quit the program.

The live video feed will be displayed in a window titled "Hexagonal Grid Overlay."

## Configuration
To modify the default hexagon size or other parameters, make adjustments within the configuration section located at the beginning of the bugeye.py script.
